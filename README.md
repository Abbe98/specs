Reconciliation API specifications
=================================

This repository hosts the specifications of the reconciliation API, which can be viewed at:

https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/

Initially, the aim is to document the existing state of the API,
as witnessed by the existing clients and servers, and the [original documentation
on OpenRefine's wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation-Service-API).
Once the existing API is documented to a satisfactory level, we will incorporate improvements
discussed in the [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/reconciliation/) in further versions
of the document.

Feel free to contribute to this documentation effort by editing `index.html`. Add yourself
to the list of editors in the preamble of the document (see the [available options](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/person)
for editor metadata).

This specification is developed using [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec) and help about
its markup can be found in its [user guide](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/ReSpec-Editor's-Guide).
