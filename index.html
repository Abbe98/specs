    <h1>Reconciliation service API</h1>
    <section id='abstract'>
      <p>
        This document describes the reconciliation service API as supported by OpenRefine 3.x.
        It is intended to comprehensive and definitive specification of this API in its given state.
        Further improvements to the API, to be discussed in the W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group,
        will be specified in the next iteration of this document.

      <h2>Core concepts</h2>
      <p>
        This section documents the data model behind the reconciliation API.
        A reconciliation service lets users match their data against <a>entities</a>
        exposed by the service. Matching can be refined by filtering by <a>type</a>
        or <a>properties</a> with <a>property values</a>.
        The purpose of this section is to define these notions.

      <h2>Service definition</h2>
      <p>
        This section documents how reconciliation services are exposed as HTTP(S) services and
        how they can announce the features of the API they implement.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>HTTP(S) access</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Cross-origin access</h3>
        <p>
           All HTTP(S) endpoints exposed by the service MUST support JSONP [[RFC6902]], which
           enables web-based clients to access the service from a different domain.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
           As of version 3.2, OpenRefine uses JSONP to access reconciliation services
           from its user interface. This applies to the service manifest and the suggest
           services. Calls to the preview service are made via an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
           from the front-end and do not require cross-origin control.
           Other calls (reconciliation queries and data extension queries) are made from the back-end
           and therefore do not require cross-origin control either. Still, this document states
           that all endpoints MUST support JSONP, since the service should not rely on the
           client's architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
           In addition, endpoints SHOULD also enable access by CORS [[cors]] to enable
           newer web-based clients to access the service without exposing themselves to 
           untrusted third-party code.
        </p>
        <p>
           This can be achieved by adding the following HTTP headers to all HTTP responses
           produced by the service:
           <pre>
             Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
             Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, Accept, Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-CSRF-Token
             Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
           </pre>
        </p>
        <p class="note">
           CORS provides a safer way to expose cross-origin web services and SHOULD therefore be 
           supported by reconciliation services, in the interest of other clients and potentially
           of newer versions of OpenRefine.
        </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Reconciliation queries</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how clients can send reconciliation queries to services and
        how services respond to them.

    <section>
      <h2>Preview service</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can provide embeddable HTML previews
        of their entities, which clients can display in their user interface.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Suggest services</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can provide auto-complete
        endpoints for their <a>entities</a>, <a>properties</a> and <a>types</a>.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Data extension service</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies how reconciliation services can let clients fetch the values
        of some <a>properties</a> on a selection of <a>entities</a>.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="appendix">
      <h2>JSON schemas</h2>
        <p>
          This appendix provides JSON schemas [[json-schema]] which can be used to validate the JSON serialization
          of various elements as specified by these specifications.
